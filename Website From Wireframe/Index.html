      <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
      
      <p>I love the energy that comes from working in a <strong>team environment</strong>, but I'm also very <strong>driven to working with startups</strong> since entrepreneurialism is in my blood!  Learning new skills, wearing multiple hats, and coming up with new ways to problems solve are some of my favorite things to do.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I’m excited to live and work in a time filled with huge advancements in technology, along with the concept of open source practices. It’s easier than ever to collaborate with others, learn from others, and effectively advance a project in a short amount of time.

    <h1 class="heading">Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>
      I call Boise, Idaho home now, but I lived all over central and southern California prior to the year 2000.  I was born and raised in California, lived mostly in Santa Barbara, and for many years enjoyed it's beaches and year round sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>  
      After moving to Boise, I embraced the North West when I discovered the easily accessible outdoor playground full of many activities I enjoyed.  Those perks coupled with its affordable cost of living and the changing landscape every season, I quickly learned to love the North West and all the friendly people there!

  <section class="questions">
    <h1 class="heading">More About Me</h1>
        <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      After finishing my <strong>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</strong>, I found that in 1984 the field of software development was    a bit difficult to work in while trying to raise a young family as a single parent.  Due to these challenges, I stayed in the technical industry by writing some of my own software, working part time for a small software developer, and spending many years as a reseller and systems instructor for the dental, medical, and veterianary industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      My career may have started out slower than I planned, but I've now returned to the industry, brought my education back up to speed, and I'm excited about how much the industry has changed.  I'm actively pursuing my original passion of becoming a software developer, and I can't wait to see what's next!
    </p>
    <h2>My Dream Job</h2>
    <p>
      That's a tough question to answer at this point, but I do dream of working on a team of creative individuals developing and enhancing websites in the physical fitness, animal advocacy or health, or even medical care industries.  Many other industries would interest me as well, but being part of a great dev team would be awesome!
    </p>
    <h2>What's Important To Me</h2>
    <p>
      Contributing to the world in ways that make a difference, and celebrating my successes along the way!
